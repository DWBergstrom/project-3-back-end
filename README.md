# The Application
Nozama is an e-commerce platform that allows users to purchase products online.

# The Process


# Unsolved Issues
Styling: We want to use bootstrap to enable the user to traverse our application cleaner with tabs and pop up windows with descriptions of the products.


Version 2: We want to be able to search products by their names in a search bar. As well as organize products by categories and remove individual items from the order.
